## 4. CSV File Format

Before initiating the import process, ensure your CSV file adheres to the specified format. This section outlines the required structure for a successful import.

If you navigate to the admin module in `https://{sellerAccountName}.myvtex.com/admin/admin-import-seller-products`, you will find a helpful tool.

Click on **Download Example** and a sample CSV file will be downloaded. This file contains a couple of rows with correctly formatted headers or fields that the CSV supports.

Use this example as a reference to structure your CSV file appropriately. Each column in the example represents a specific data field required for successful product importation. Ensure that your CSV file follows a similar structure to avoid any potential issues during the import process.

By adhering to the provided example, you streamline the preparation of your CSV file, making the importation process smoother and more efficient.

Each row in the CSV file symbolizes a single SKU. Therefore, if you intend to add a product with multiple SKUs, each SKU must have a separate row. To signify that different rows are associated with the same product, maintain consistency in the `productId` or `productExternalId`. If these identifiers remain the same across rows, it indicates that the SKUs belong to the same product. Conversely, a change in these identifiers implies a new product.

Letâ€™s review each field:

1. **productId**: This field serves as a unique identifier for each product at VTEX. **If you are performing an update to existing products, you should include this column in your CSV file**. However, **when creating new products, it is crucial to omit this value**. The system will automatically generate a unique identifier (productId) for new products during the creation process.

2. **productExternalId**: This field represents the external identifier for each product. It serves as a unique reference number within the store. The productExternalId allows you to associate your products with external systems or databases. Ensure that each product has a distinct productExternalId to avoid any ambiguity or conflicts in identification. This external identifier aids in efficiently managing and referencing products across various platforms and systems.

3. **productStatus**: This field indicates the status of the product, specifying whether it is `active` or `inactive`. The status determines whether the product is currently available for display and purchase. Use **active** to denote products that are live and ready for customer interaction, while **inactive** can be used for products that are temporarily unavailable or discontinued.

4. **productName**: This field represents the name of the product. It is crucial for product identification and SEO optimization. Ensure that the product name consists of simple and clear words, avoiding complex language or terms in other languages. Additionally, adhere to the 150-character limit to optimize search engine visibility and provide concise yet informative product names for customers. A well-crafted product name contributes to a compelling and effective product presentation.

5. **brandId**: This field contains the identifier for the brand of the product. It represents a unique identifier number associated with the product's brand.

6. **categoryIds**: This field includes the identifier(s) for the category or categories to which the product belongs. Each category or subcategory is assigned a unique identifier number, and a product can be associated with multiple category IDs. The category IDs help organize and classify products within the store, facilitating effective navigation for customers.
