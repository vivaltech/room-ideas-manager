## 4. CSV File Format

Before initiating the import process, ensure your CSV file adheres to the specified format. This section outlines the required structure for a successful import.

If you navigate to the admin module in `https://{sellerAccountName}.myvtex.com/admin/admin-import-seller-products`, you will find a helpful tool.

Click on **Download Example** and a sample CSV file will be downloaded. This file contains a couple of rows with correctly formatted headers or fields that the CSV supports.

Use this example as a reference to structure your CSV file appropriately. Each column in the example represents a specific data field required for successful product importation. Ensure that your CSV file follows a similar structure to avoid any potential issues during the import process.

By adhering to the provided example, you streamline the preparation of your CSV file, making the importation process smoother and more efficient.

Each row in the CSV file symbolizes a single SKU. Therefore, if you intend to add a product with multiple SKUs, each SKU must have a separate row. To signify that different rows are associated with the same product, maintain consistency in the productId or productExternalId or productName. If these identifiers remain the same across rows, it indicates that the SKUs belong to the same product. Conversely, a change in these identifiers implies a new product.

Letâ€™s review each field:

1. **productId**: This field serves as a unique identifier for each product at VTEX. **If you are performing an update to existing products, you should include this column in your CSV file**. However, **when creating new products, it is crucial to omit this value**. The system will automatically generate a unique identifier (productId) for new products during the creation process.

2. **productExternalId**: This field represents the external identifier for each product. It serves as a unique reference number within the store. The productExternalId allows you to associate your products with external systems or databases. Ensure that each product has a distinct productExternalId to avoid any ambiguity or conflicts in identification. This external identifier aids in efficiently managing and referencing products across various platforms and systems.

3. **productName**: This field represents the name of the product. It is crucial for product identification and SEO optimization. Ensure that the product name consists of simple and clear words, avoiding complex language or terms in other languages. Additionally, adhere to the 150-character limit to optimize search engine visibility and provide concise yet informative product names for customers. A well-crafted product name contributes to a compelling and effective product presentation.

4. **brandId**: This field contains the identifier for the brand of the product. It represents a unique identifier number associated with the product's brand.

5. **categoryIds**: This field includes the identifier(s) for the category or categories to which the product belongs. Each category or subcategory is assigned a unique identifier number, and a product can be associated with multiple category IDs. The category IDs help organize and classify products within the store, facilitating effective navigation for customers.

| **productAttributes** contains attributes of the product. Attributes are additional properties used to create site browsing filters. This field was divided into: |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **productAttributes_name_1** related to **productAttributes_value_1**                                                                                             |
| **productAttributes_name_2** related to **productAttributes_value_2**                                                                                             |
| **productAttributes_name_3** related to **productAttributes_value_3**                                                                                             |
| **...**                                                                                                                                                           |

14. **skuId**: The skuId serves as the distinctive identifier for the SKU. This unique identifier is assigned to each SKU within the system. Importantly, **when creating new skus, it is crucial to omit this value**. The system will autonomously generate a unique `skuId` for new products during the creation process.
    However, **if you are performing updates to existing products, it becomes crucial to include the skuId column in your CSV file**. This identifier is essential for accurately associating modifications with the corresponding SKUs. By understanding this distinction, you contribute to a seamless and error-free product importation process.

15. **skuExternalId**: The `skuExternalId` serves as an external identifier for the SKU. This unique reference code is crafted to enhance the organization of the store. It provides a valuable means of identification for the SKU in external systems or processes.

16. **skuEan**: The `skuEan` is the EAN (International Article Number) assigned to the SKU. This unique barcode comprises up to 13 numeric characters, providing a standardized identification code for the SKU. The EAN is crucial for accurate and efficient tracking of the SKU across various systems.

| **skuImage_url** encompasses URLs of images associated with the sku. This this images will be assign on each SKU. This field was divided into: |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **. . .**                                                                                                                                      |
| **skuImage_url_10**                                                                                                                            |

17. **skuImage_url_1 (Required)**: Signifies the URL of one image of this `sku`. You have the flexibility to use external URLs, such as those from Google Drive.

    - If the URL is external, we will save the images in VTEX before importing the products. In the case of Google Drive URLs, it is essential to follow this specific format: `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id={id}`, where id represents the unique identifier associated with the image content. **Example**: [https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1YT19jigO7R4W4wLGkvXIngCtrRIol7s1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1YT19jigO7R4W4wLGkvXIngCtrRIol7s1)
    - If the URL is internal, it should be formatted as `https://{accountName}.vtexassets.com/assets/{path}`. **Example**: [https://spvaltechqa733.vtexassets.com/assets/vtex.catalog-images/products/water_img_1\_\_\_128a77fee20713a5b8b69da81912fb82.png](https://spvaltechqa733.vtexassets.com/assets/vtex.catalog-images/products/water_img_1___128a77fee20713a5b8b69da81912fb82.png)

### 4.1. Calculated Columns

In the latest update [1.3.0] on April 26, 2024, significant changes have been implemented in the import process of the app. Notably, some columns have been removed from the CSV format, while new calculated columns have been introduced within the app's logic. These calculated columns are generated dynamically based on existing data or specific rules outlined in the update. Below, you'll find comprehensive details regarding these newly added calculated columns:

1. **productSlug**: The product slug column generates a unique slug for each product based on the product name. Special characters are removed, and spaces are replaced with hyphens (-). Additionally, any accented characters are normalized (e.g., Ã¡ becomes a, Ã§ becomes c).

2. **productSpecs**: The product specs column aggregates the specifications of each SKU associated with the product. Product Specs = Concatenation of SKU Specs for each sku of the same product.

3. **productStatus**: The product status column indicates the status of each product, which is **always set as active**.

4. **productImages**: Each row will have a couple of `skuImage_url` encompasses URLs of images associated with the SKU.

   - If multiple SKUs belong to the same product, the images of each SKU are accumulated to generate the productImages.
   - The `imageId` of each `productImage` is generated from `productName` normalized + `_X` (where X is the number of image) + `.png`.
   - The `imageAlt` of each `productImage` is generated from `productName` normalized + `_X` (where X is the number of image).
   - Example:
     - CVS:
       ![Product Images CSV](./images/productImagesCSV.png)
     - Result:
       ![Product Images Result](./images/productImagesResult.png)

5. **skuIsActive**: The SKU is active column indicates whether each SKU is active, which is **always set as true**.

6. **skuName**: The SKU name column generates a descriptive name for each SKU based on the product name and the values of the SKU specs.
   - Lets say the product name is T-Shirt and the SKU specs are White/Black and S/M/L the skus name should be like:
     - T-Shirt **White S**
     - T-Shirt **White M**
     - T-Shirt **White L**
     - T-Shirt **Black S**

Each column plays a crucial role in providing information about the product and its associated SKUs. Ensure that your CSV file adheres to this structure for a successful import process. If you have any specific questions about a particular column or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
