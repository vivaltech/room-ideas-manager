### Added

- Add `wakeUp` to fix first call. (If this doesn't work, we need to use a fetch instead of gql mutation).
- `productSlug` is generated based on the `productName` removing special characters and replacing spaces with `-` and is normalize (convert รก -> a and รง -> c).
- `productSpecs` is generated based on the `skuSpecs` from each product.
- Add `productStatus` as `active` always.
- Add `skuIsActive` as `true` always.
- Add `skuName` generated from `productName` + values of the `skuSpecs`.
- Add `skuImage_url_X (1 to 10)`, each row have the image of that sku.
  - If 2 different skus are from the same product, the accumulation of the images of each sku generates the `productImages`.
  - `imageId` is generated from `productName` normalized + `_X` (where X is the number of image) + `.png`.
  - `imageAlt` is generated from `productName` normalized + `_X` (where X is the number of image).
- `productName` can be used as a column to know if 2 or more skus are from the same product.

### Fixed

- Contemplate the conflict if the image id already exist and use it.
- Change message `Is Active` to `Status`
