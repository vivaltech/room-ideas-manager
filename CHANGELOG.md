## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `wakeUp` to fix first call. (If this doesn't work, we need to use a fetch instead of gql mutation).
- Product Slug is generated based on the product name removing special characters and replacing spaces with `-` and is normalize (convert รก -> a and รง -> c).
- Product Spec is generated based on the `skuSpecs` from each product.
- Add `productStatus` as `active` always.
- Add `skuIsActive` as `true` always.

### Fixed

- Contemplate the conflict if the image id already exist and use it.

### Removed

- Remove `productTransportModal, productTaxCode, skuManufacturerCode` columns from csv.
- Remove `productSlug` column from csv and generate it based on productName.
- Remove `productSpecs (name_1 to name_5 and values_1 to values_5)` columns from csv and generate it based on `skuSpecs`.
- Remove `productStatus, skuIsActive` and add value as default.
